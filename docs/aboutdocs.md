# About this documentation

This documentation is work in progress, the articles are being updated on a regular base.

## Documentation structure

This documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), for a streamlined and simple user experience. Each **page** will concern a particular topic, giving **detailed and illustrated explanations** and **instructions** about it. Every page is broken down to different level headings.

The navigation sidebar on the left side of this page will represent the **chapters** as expandable topics, with the **sections** listed in each expanded view.

## Illustrations

For preparing the screenshots for this documentation we use shapes from the following SVG file.

![Shapes for preparing graphics](/media/inkscape-shapes.svg)

We used another great open source product called [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for the creation of the graphics.

The color of the shapes has the following HEX encoding: `#ef2dae`

## Text markup

You will notice, that certain words are marked with **bold text**. These either mean names of elements, or significant notes/concepts about usage. _Italicized words_ usually mark menu items, or other selectable elements, although it is not a hard and fast rule.

Bulleted lists will be used to

- Improve **readability**
- Make it **easier to find** what you are looking for.

## Document symbols

There are currently two types of symbols, apart from the usual text formatting and annotations, that you can find on these pages:

- <ProFeature /> - means that the described feature is part of the TagSpaces Pro and Custom editions.
- âš’ - means that the section is not ready yet and may contain unclear, or not up-to-date information, or sections might be missing entirely.
