[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is a globally distributed network platform known for its CDN, DNS, and security services.  
Its **R2 Object Storage** is an affordable, S3-compatible storage solution designed for developers and small teams who want to store data in the cloud **without egress fees** ‚Äî a major advantage compared to traditional cloud providers.

R2 integrates easily with many S3-compatible tools, including **TagSpaces**, allowing you to use it as a remote file location for tagging, browsing, and organizing your content.

**Advantages**

- No egress bandwidth fees
- S3-compatible API
- Hosted on Cloudflare‚Äôs globally distributed infrastructure
- Integrated with Cloudflare Workers and CDN

<!-- **Limitations**

- Limited region choices (as of now)
- Requires Cloudflare account management for API keys and permissions -->

After registration, you‚Äôll see the **R2 Object Storage** dashboard, which lists your existing buckets.  
From this screen, you can create new buckets and manage the **API tokens** needed to connect with TagSpaces.

In the R2 dashboard, click **Create Bucket** to open the setup screen.  
Here, you can choose:

- **Bucket name** ‚Äì this will be required later in TagSpaces
- **Storage location** ‚Äì choose your preferred data region and jurisdiction
- **Storage class** ‚Äì standard or low-frequency, depending on your usage

Once created, go to the **bucket settings** page.  
Here you‚Äôll find the **S3 API endpoint URL**, which will be required when setting up the connection in TagSpaces.

## Creating access tokens

Access tokens are required to connect your Cloudflare R2 bucket to TagSpaces.  
They can be created directly from the R2 overview screen.

Go to **Manage API Tokens** and from the next screen choose **Create User API token**:

- **Bucket access** ‚Äì specify which buckets the token can access
