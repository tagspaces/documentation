# Install TagSpaces Web on Cloudflare

In this tutorial you will learn how to install TagSpaces Web or TagSpaces Pro Web on a **Cloudflare Pages**.

**Cloudflare** is a cloud provider, offering with their [**Pages**](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) product a completely free way for hosting static web pages, with https support and unlimited bandwidth.

## Register a free account on Cloudflare

Go to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and sign up for a new account.

## Install Wrangler 2.0 CLI

Wrangler is command line application offered by Cloudflare for managing the deployments. Install it globally with the following command:

```
npm install -g wrangler
```

## Authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account

Open the terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to connect wrangler to your Cloudflare account.

```
wrangler login
```

## Unzip tagspaces-web package

Extract the content of the **TagSpaces Web** or **TagSpaces Pro Web** package to a folder from which you will later manage the deployments and open a terminal / command line prompt there.

## Create new deployment

Execute the following command and follow the instruction to create a new Cloudflare deployment.

```
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE npx wrangler pages publish web
```

Here **web** is the folder of the unzipped tagspaces' package.
