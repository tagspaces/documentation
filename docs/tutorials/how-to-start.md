# Getting Started with TagSpaces

Welcome to **TagSpaces**, your privacy-friendly file manager and organizer.  
This guide will help you get started quickly after downloading and installing the app.

---

## Launching TagSpaces for the First Time

When you start TagSpaces, after you accept the software license, you’ll be greeted by the **Welcome Screen**.  
From here, you can:

- Create or connect a **location** (a folder you want to manage with TagSpaces)
- Explore the **intro tour** to understand the interface
- Open existing folders on your computer or cloud storage

<!-- > 💡 **Tip:**  -->

:::tip
TagSpaces never uploads your data anywhere by default. All your files stay where they are — on your local drive or your object storage.
:::

---

## Understanding “Locations”

A **location** is simply a folder from your computer, an external drive, or an S3-compatible cloud bucket.

<!-- > 🔒 **Privacy Note:** TagSpaces reads and writes directly to your files — it does not upload or track any data. -->

TagSpaces connect automatically some of your standard folders like the **Downloads**, **Documents**, **Music** and **Desktop**. The **Locations** are visible on the left area of the application window.

The standard locations are fully optional you can remove them or create new locations pointing to folders which contain files you want to manage in TagSpaces.

**To create a new location:**

1. Click the **“New button”** on the top left part of the main screen, and the choose **New Location** from the menu.

4. Give the location a recognizable name.

<CenteredImage src="/media/how-to-start/adjusting-location.avif" caption="Giving a suitable name for your location" showCaption/>

TagSpaces takes automatically the name of the chosen folder as name for the location. You can change this name something else in this dialog.

5. Now you can browse, tag, and organize all files inside that location directly within TagSpaces.

:::info Connecting cloud locations
TagSpaces can connect to folders located on object storage. The object storage can be hosted on a [NAS](/tutorials/folders-as-objectstorage-with-s3proxy) or in the Cloud like on [AWS S3](/tutorials/s3-bucket-locations), [Cloudflare R2](/tutorials/tagspaces-web-cloudflare), [Wasabi](/tutorials/wasabi-locations) or [Contabo](/tutorials/wasabi-locations).

## Navigating the Interface

TagSpaces uses a clean, two-panel layout:

- **Left panel:** lists your connected locations and tag groups
- **Main area:** displays folder contents using a **perspective** (grid, list, gallery, map, etc.)
- **Top bar:** provides search, sorting, and settings access

Drag and drop files freely between folders or arrange them visually in Kanban boards.

---

## Tagging Your Files and Folders

Tags are at the heart of TagSpaces. They help you organize and find files faster.

**To tag a file:**

1. Select the file.
2. Open the **Tag Panel** on the right.
3. Drag an existing tag, or create a new one.

You can group tags by category — for example:  
🧾 _Document Type_, 🎨 _Project_, 🌍 _Location_, or 📅 _Year_.

> ⚙️ **Tagging method:** Choose between storing tags in filenames or in sidecar files (`.json`).  
> Adjust this in **Settings → Tagging Method**.

---

TagSpaces includes built-in editors for:

- **Markdown** (recommended for note-taking)
- **Plain text**
- **HTML** (for formatted documents)

**To create a note:**

1. Click the **“+ New File”** button.
2. Select a format.
3. Start typing — your note is saved as a regular file in your folder.
