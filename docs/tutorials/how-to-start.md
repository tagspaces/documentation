# Getting Started with TagSpaces

Welcome to **TagSpaces**, your privacy-friendly file manager and organizer.  
This guide will help you get started quickly after downloading and installing the app.

---

## Launching for the First Time

When you start TagSpaces, after you accept the software license, you‚Äôll be greeted by the **Welcome Screen**.  
From here, you can:

- Create or connect a **location** (a folder you want to manage with TagSpaces)
- Explore the **intro tour** to understand the interface
- Open existing folders on your computer or cloud storage

<!-- > üí° **Tip:**  -->

:::tip
TagSpaces never uploads your data anywhere by default. All your files stay where they are ‚Äî on your local drive or your object storage.
:::

---

## Understanding ‚ÄúLocations‚Äù

A **location** is simply a folder from your computer, an external drive, or an S3-compatible cloud bucket.

<!-- > üîí **Privacy Note:** TagSpaces reads and writes directly to your files ‚Äî it does not upload or track any data. -->

TagSpaces connect automatically some of your standard folders like the **Downloads**, **Documents**, **Music** and **Desktop**. The **Locations** are visible on the left area of the application window.

<CenteredImage src="/media/how-to-start/default-locations.avif" caption="Default locations in the location manager" showCaption/>

The standard locations are fully optional you can remove them or create new locations pointing to folders which contain files you want to manage in TagSpaces.

**To create a new location:**

1. Click the **‚ÄúNew button‚Äù** on the top left part of the main screen, and the choose **New Location** from the menu.

4. Give the location a recognizable name.

<CenteredImage src="/media/how-to-start/adjusting-location.avif" caption="Giving a suitable name for your location" showCaption/>

TagSpaces takes automatically the name of the chosen folder as name for the location. You can change this name to something else in this dialog.

5. Now you can browse, tag, and organize all files inside that location directly within TagSpaces.

## Navigating the Interface

TagSpaces uses a clean, two-panel layout:

    maxWidth="100%"
    autoPlay
    caption="Video showing various ways to apply tags to files and folders"
