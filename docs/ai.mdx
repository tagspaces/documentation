Starting with version 6.1.1, the TagSpaces desktop application allows you to connect to [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as an external AI service provider. Ollama is a **locally installed offline** software that enables running AI models (LLMs - large language models) directly on your computer.

:::tip
TagSpaces does not have its own AI engine or models but relies entirely on external AI software like Ollama for these features. **All AI features are disabled by default**.
:::

## Prerequisites

- A modern PC with a recent Nvidia/AMD graphics card or a Mac with an Apple Silicon processor. Ollama also works on regular CPUs, but performance may be slower.
- [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and install the Ollama software.
- At least 10 GB of free hard drive space for LLMs.

## AI Configuration

In the settings, a new tab called **AI** is available. Here, you can add AI engines and manage their models.

### Adding an AI Engine

After installing Ollama, you can add it by clicking the **Add AI Engine** button in TagSpaces.

/>

If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a new section labeled "Ollama" with a green indicator, meaning Ollama is running in the background. If there are connection issues, the indicator will turn red.

/>

By default, the configuration assumes the Ollama service is running on your local machine `https://localhost:11434`. However, it can also run on other computers in your network. You can add multiple Ollama configurations using the **Add AI Engine** button. Select the desired engine in the **Default AI Engine** dropdown.

### Downloading Models

The next step is to download a suitable model (LLM). This can be done via the **Default model for text-based tasks** dropdown.

/>

In the "Example installable AI models" section, you can choose a suitable model. For text-based tasks, we suggest the **llama3.2** model. For image-based tasks (e.g., image description), you can use *llava* or *llama3.2-vision*. While *llama3.2-vision* delivers better results, it is significantly slower.

Once you select a model, a progress dialog will show the download status. Note that models are typically several gigabytes in size, so patience is required.

If you can't find the desired model, you can install additional ones using Ollama's [command-line tool](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#cli-reference).

## AI Chat in Folders

If configured correctly, a new button will appear next to the perspective switcher in the folder area. Clicking it opens the **AI Chat** tab in the folder properties.

<CenteredImage

At the top of the tab, select the model for the AI chat. At the bottom, use the AI prompt to ask questions.

/>

You can maintain a separate chat for each folder, enabling chat-based research or project organization directly in folders.

:::warning
All chat history, including dropped images, is saved in the **ai** folder within the **.ts** subfolder of the current folder. Deleting the **ai** folder or the current folder will delete the chat history.

## AI Features for Files

<ProFeature /> AI-related file features are part of the PRO version. These functionalities are currently available:

- **Generate image descriptions** for JPG and PNG files.
- **Generate tags** from image descriptions.

### Upcoming AI Features

The following features are on the development roadmap for TagSpaces. 

- Text-based file summarization
- Batch processing for multiple files
- Integration with additional AI engines
- Extraction of dominant colors in images
- Translation of generated content
- Language configuration for generated content
- Adding the AI features also in the web version
