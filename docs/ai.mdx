Starting with the version 6.1.1 the TagSpaces desktop application you can connect to Ollama and use it as external AI service provider. [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)) is a software which can be installed **locally** on your computer and which will provide the ability to run AI models (LLMs - large language models) locally on your computer.

:::tip
TagSpaces' products do not have its own AI-engine or AI-models, but relay entirely on external AI-software such as Ollama for this functionality. All the **AI-features are turned off** by default.
:::

## Prerequisites

- A modern PC with a recent Nvidia/AMD graphic card or Mac with Apple Silicon processor. Ollama will work also on regular CPUs but the performance will be slow.
- [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and install Ollama software.
- at least 10 GBs of free hard drive space for the LLMs.

## AI Configuration

In the settings of the a new tab called **AI** can be found. Here you can add AI-engines and manage the AI-models for these engines

###  Add AI-engine.
After you install ollama on your computer you can add it, be clicking the "Add AI engine" button in TagSpaces.

If everything went ok you will see a new section, called Ollama having a green indicator, symbolising that the Ollama is running in the background. If there are connection issues the indicator will be red.

The default configuration is looking for the ollama service on your local machine (url: https://localhost:11434), but it can be on another computers in your network. You can have also more then one Ollama configurations in TagSpaces. Just add another one with the **Add AI Engine** button. Which one of the AI-engines is currently used can be selected in the **Default AI Engine** dropdown.

### Downloading models
Next important step is download a suitable model (LLM). This can be done in the "Default model for text-based tasks" dropdown.
<CenteredImage

/>
In the section "Example installable AI models" you can choose a suitable model. For text based tasks we have made a good experience with the **llama3.2** model. For image based tasks, such as description of an image, we have worked with *llava* and *llama3.2-vision*. The last one is significantly slower but creates better results.

Once you select a model from the list a progress dialog will appear, where you can see the status of the download process. The model's sizes vary a lot but they are usually many GBs big, so be patient.

If you do not find the model you want you can install further models from the ollama's [command line tool](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#cli-reference).

## AI Chat in Folders
If everything is configured correctly you will find a new button to the right of the perspective switcher buttons in the folder area. Click on the button to open the **AI Chat** tab in the folder properties. 
<CenteredImage

On top of the tab, you can choose the model you want to use for the AI-cat. At the bottom of the tab you will find the AI prompt, where you can ask questions.

/>

So now you can have a separate chat in every folder you manage in TagSpaces. This way you can organize your chat-based research or project simply in folders.

:::warning
All the chat history including the images you have dropped in the AI-prompt are saved in the **ai** folder located in the **.ts** sub folder of the current folder. Deleting the **ai** or the folder itself will delete all the chat history.

## AI-features for files

<ProFeature /> The file related AI-features will be part of the PRO version. We have added the following functionalities so far.

* Generate description of an image in JPG and PNG formats.
* Generate tags from the description of a file.

### AI-features in our roadmap

* Generate summary of text-based files
* Batch operations on many files
* Integration of further AI-engines
* Extraction of the lead colors in images
* Translation of generated content
* Configuration the langauge in which the content is generated
