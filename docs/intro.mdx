# TagSpaces Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the TagSpaces products!

## What is TagSpaces ?

TagSpaces is an open source, cross-platform, no backend, no login, file manager, organizer and browser. It helps you organize your files, photos and other documents with tags on different platforms and/or devices, according to your own preferences and following your own logic, by using the same smart and friendly interface everywhere.

## Key Features

## Philosophy

- TagSpaces follows a no backend and no login philosophy
- It is not a SaaS but a front-end application, where the files system or the object storage plays the role of a back-end.
- The application is not Internet dependent, a pure offline use is possible
- TagSpaces is not saving the meta information in a database -> no vendor locking, no lost information on database crashes or installations on a new computer
- All the needed information is extracted by the time of use from your files and folders.
- File system as a database
- The supported tagging options makes a folder with tagged files self containing all the needed information, which useful by e.g. syncing
- No database or vendor locking
- Easy to synchronize between devices, just use TagSpaces with your Dropbox/NextCloud/Google Drive folder
- Saving the tags in the filename enables you to use the search capabilities of your operating system
