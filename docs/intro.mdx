## Philosophy

- **No Backend, No Login:** TagSpaces follows a no-backend, no-login philosophy, meaning it works entirely offline without needing an internet connection.
- **Local File System as a Backend:** TagSpaces is a front-end application that uses your file system (or object storage) as the backend.
- **Database-Free:** Metadata is stored in your files and folders, preventing data loss in case of crashes, and eliminating vendor lock-in.
- **Sync-Friendly:** Use cloud services like Dropbox, NextCloud, or Google Drive to easily synchronize tagged files between devices.
- **Searchable:** Tags stored in filenames can be searched using your operating system's search functionality.
